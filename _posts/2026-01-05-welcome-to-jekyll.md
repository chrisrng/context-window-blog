Welcome to your new Jekyll blog! This is your first post.

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity.

## Getting Started

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes.

## Writing Posts

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

## Code Highlighting

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```python
def print_hi(name):
    print(f"Hi, {name}")

print_hi('Tom')
```

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
