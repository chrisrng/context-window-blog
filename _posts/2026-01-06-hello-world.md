title: Hello World!
---

I’m starting a new blog after a long hiatus from my own writing [since around ~2018](https://chrisrng.svbtle.com), following my work as an editor on the [LinkedIn Engineering Blog](https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog) and the [The Ember Times](https://blog.emberjs.com/author/chris-ng/).

In the years since, I’ve spoken at conferences such as [EmberFest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpljvcBUye0), [EmberConf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t7O9N87tOqs), [LibertyJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4cb7TGV3C8), and [ForwardJS](https://twitter.com/chrisrng/status/1266020465656631296), and spent time on the [Ember Learning Core Team](https://emberjs.com/teams/emeritus/#:~:text=Chris%20Ng).

This blog will start by curating noteworthy articles I think are worth reading, especially around technical leadership, software architecture, and software development. I’ll add my own commentary, and it will serve as my public bookmark archive. Over time, I hope to grow it into a place for longer-form writing.
