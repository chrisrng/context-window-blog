title: Year In Review 2025

From https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/

> "What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals."

> "humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools [is] the product design question we need to debate and answer"

> "For AI to have societal permission it must have real world eval impact."

From https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/

> "By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like "reasoning" to humans - they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples)."

> "[LLMs] are at the same time a genius polymath and a confused and cognitively challenged grade schooler, seconds away from getting tricked by a jailbreak to exfiltrate your data"

> "Training on the test set is a new art form."

How you evaluate AI-native applications 

> "Will the LLM labs capture all applications or are there green pastures for LLM apps [like Cursor]?"

We're back to the thick client vs thin client debate (I still remember doing tests on verifying a Blackberry thin client migration!) but as we saw with [SPAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) it's more of a hybrid solution moving forward.

> "Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like [...] Anthropic got this order of precedence correct and packaged CC into a delightful, minimal CLI form factor that changed what AI looks like - it's not just a website you go to like Google, it's a little spirit/ghost that "lives" on your computer. This is a new, distinct paradigm of interaction with an AI."
