> "What matters is not the power of any given model, but how people choose to apply it to achieve their goals."

This is consistent with what I’ve seen where the people who use these tools continue to reap the benefits and maximize them to fulfill their goals (for the most part, it's key not to get too distracted fiddling with it). Those that didn't want to try (or didn't have time to try) were not swayed with more powerful models.

> "humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools [is] the product design question we need to debate and answer"

> "For AI to have societal permission it must have real world eval impact."

From https://karpathy.bearblog.dev/year-in-review-2025/

> "By training LLMs against automatically verifiable rewards across a number of environments (e.g. think math/code puzzles), the LLMs spontaneously develop strategies that look like "reasoning" to humans - they learn to break down problem solving into intermediate calculations and they learn a number of problem solving strategies for going back and forth to figure things out (see DeepSeek R1 paper for examples)."

> "[LLMs] are at the same time a genius polymath and a confused and cognitively challenged grade schooler, seconds away from getting tricked by a jailbreak to exfiltrate your data"

> "Training on the test set is a new art form."

How you evaluate AI-native applications becomes it's competitive edge since

> "Will the LLM labs capture all applications or are there green pastures for LLM apps [like Cursor]?"

We're back to the thick client vs thin client debate (I still remember doing tests on verifying a Blackberry thin client migration!) but as we saw with [SPAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) it's more of a hybrid solution moving forward.

> "Claude Code (CC) emerged as the first convincing demonstration of what an LLM Agent looks like [...] Anthropic got this order of precedence correct and packaged CC into a delightful, minimal CLI form factor that changed what AI looks like - it's not just a website you go to like Google, it's a little spirit/ghost that "lives" on your computer. This is a new, distinct paradigm of interaction with an AI."

> "not only does vibe coding empower regular people to approach programming, it empowers trained professionals to write a lot more (vibe coded) software that would otherwise never be written [...] code is suddenly free, ephemeral, malleable, discardable after single use"

> "[On Nano banana being the first hint of an LLM GUI] in terms of the UIUX, "chatting" with LLMs is a bit like issuing commands to a computer console in the 1980s. Text is the raw/favored data representation for computers (and LLMs), but it is not the favored format for people, especially at the input. People actually dislike reading text - it is slow and effortful. Instead, people love to consume information visually and spatially and this is why the GUI has been invented in traditional computing. In the same way, LLMs should speak to us in our favored format - in images, infographics, slides, whiteboards, animations/videos, web apps, etc.
